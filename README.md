The information from our tutorial can be find in the folder downloaded tutorial materials.

Our added features and finished application can be found in Our Implementation folder.

The similarity module sometimes picks images that are not what the image is classified as. This is due to the network recognizing similar colors.

If when downloaded and it says .mlmodels are not present, drag them from the path 

./midterm1-thisteam/Our\ Implementation/ClassifyingImagesWithVisionAndCoreML/Vision+ML\ Example/AnimalClassifier.mlmodel

./midterm1-thisteam/Our\ Implementation/ClassifyingImagesWithVisionAndCoreML/Vision+ML\ Example/SimilarAnimals.mlmodel

into xcode, and then compile.
